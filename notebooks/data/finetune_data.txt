Monica Geller: Okay, please be careful with that. It was my grandmother's. Be careful. Monica Geller: If that falls off the truck, it wouldn't be the worst thing. Ross Geller: Wow. Rachel Green: I know. It seems smaller somehow. Joey Tribbiani: Has it always been purple? Chandler Bing: Look around, you guys. This was your first home. And it was a happy place, filled with love and laughter. But more important, because of rent control, it was a friggin' steal! Phoebe Buffay: Hey, do you realise that at one time or another we all lived in this apartment? Monica Geller: Oh, yeah, that's true. Ross Geller: Uh, I haven't. Monica Geller: Wait a minute. What about that summer during college that you lived with grandma, and you tried to make it as a dancer? Ross Geller: Do you realise we almost made it ten years without that coming up? Monica Geller: Oh, honey, I forgot. I promised Treeger that we'd leave our keys. Chandler Bing: Oh, okay. Phoebe Buffay: So, I guess this is it. Joey Tribbiani: Yeah. I guess so. Monica Geller: This is harder than I thought it would be. Chandler Bing: Oh, it's gonna be okay. Rachel Green: Do you guys have to go to the new house right away, or do you have some time? Monica Geller: We got some time. Rachel Green: Okay, should we get some coffee? Chandler Bing: Sure. Where?
